## Prerequisites

### Go

To work in this codebase, you will want to have Go version 1.12+ installed.

## Documentation

The full documentation for the Cyberark Secrets Provider for Kubernetes can be found [here](https://docs.cyberark.com/Product-Doc/OnlineHelp/AAM-DAP/Latest/en/Content/Integrations/Kubernetes_deployApplicationsConjur-k8s-Secrets.htm) for Conjur Enterprise and [here](https://docs.conjur.org/Latest/en/Content/Integrations/Kubernetes_deployApplicationsConjur-k8s-Secrets.htm) for Conjur Open Source.

### Get up and running

Before you can start contributing to the CyberArk Secrets Provider for Kubernetes project, you must:

1. Setup your environment. 
    
    a. For detailed instructions on how to setup a Conjur Enterprise env, see [Conjur Enterprise Setup](https://docs.cyberark.com/Product-Doc/OnlineHelp/AAM-DAP/Latest/en/Content/HomeTilesLPs/LP-Tile1.htm).
    
    b. For detailed instructions on how to setup a Conjur Open Source env, see [Conjur Open Source Setup](https://docs.conjur.org/Latest/en/Content/HomeTilesLPs/LP-Tile1.htm).

2. Setup the CyberArk Secrets Provider for Kubernetes

    a. For detailed setup instructions for Conjur Enterprise, see [CyberArk Secrets Provider for Kubernetes for Conjur Enterprise](https://docs.cyberark.com/Product-Doc/OnlineHelp/AAM-DAP/Latest/en/Content/Integrations/Kubernetes_deployApplicationsConjur-k8s-Secrets.htm).
    
    b. For detailed setup instructions for Conjur Open Source, see [CyberArk Secrets Provider for Kubernetes for Conjur Open Source](https://docs.conjur.org/Latest/en/Content/Integrations/Kubernetes_deployApplicationsConjur-k8s-Secrets.htm).
    
### Deploy a Local Dev Environment (K8s)

You can now deploy a local development environment for Kubernetes using [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).Â Docker Desktop provides a convenient way to deploy and develop from your machine against a locally deployed cluster. 

#### Prerequisites

1. [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed

1. Kubernetes enabled in Docker Desktop

    1. Navigate to Docker Preferences
    
    1. Click on the Kubernetes tab and "Enable Kubernetes"
    
1. The Secrets Provider for K8s uses the [Kubernetes Conjur deploy](https://github.com/cyberark/kubernetes-conjur-deploy/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) repository to deploy Conjur Enterprise / Conjur Open Source on Kubernetes. 
   By default, 2.0 Gib of memory is allocated to Docker on your computer.
   
   To successfully deploy a Conjur Enterprise cluster (Leader + Followers + Standbys), you will need to increase the memory limit to 6 Gib. To do so, perform the following:
   
   1. Navigate to Docker preferences
   
   1. Click on "Resources" and slide the "Memory" bar to 6
  
1. If you intend to deploy the Secrets Provider via Helm, you will need to install the Helm CLI. See [here](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) for instructions on how to do so.

#### Deploy a local development environment

To deploy a local development environment, perform the following:

1. Run `./bin/build` to build the Secrets Provider image locally 

1. Ensure you are in the proper local context. Otherwise, the deployment will not run successfully

Run ` kubectl config current-context` to verify which context you are currently in so if needed, you can switch back to it easily

Run `kubectl config use-context docker-desktop` to switch to a local context. This is the context you will need to run the development environment

1. Navigate to `bootstrap.env` and uncomment the `Local DEV Env` section, ensuring that `DEV=true`. Additionally, you can deploy the Secrets Provider locally using HELM. To do so, _also_ uncomment `DEV_HELM`

1. Run `./bin/start --dev`, appending `--oss` or `--dap` according to the environment that needs to be deployed

1. To view the pod(s) that were deployed and the Secrets Provider logs, run `kubectl get pods` and `kubectl logs <pod-name> -c cyberark-secrets-provider-for-k8s` respectively. 
You can also view Conjur Enterprise / Conjur Open Source pod logs by running `kubectl get pods -n local-conjur` and `kubectl logs <conjur-pod-name> -n local-conjur`

1. If a cluster is already locally deployed run `./bin/start --dev --reload` to build your local changes and redeploy them to the local Secrets Provider K8s cluster

#### Run e2e tests against local development environment

Assuming you have a running local cluster per the previous section and a valid kubeconfig, you can run the Golang-based e2e tests by simply running `./bin/test_e2e` from the project root folder. This will build a test container with the kubeconfig mounted, and execute the tests against the local cluster.

NOTE: This assumes that the cluster is running with the default values in `bootstrap.env` for local DEV clusters.

#### Clean-up

To remove K8s resources from your local environment perform the following:

1. Run `kubectl get all --all-namespaces` to list all resources across all namespaces in your cluster

1. Run `kubectl delete <resource-type> <name-of-resource> --namespace <namespace>`

Note that for Deployments, you must first delete the Deployment and then the Pod. Otherwise the Pod will terminate and another will start it its place.

#### Limitations

- Currently, deploying a local dev environment only works against a local K8s cluster and not an Openshift one

- At current, we cannot run our integration tests locally, only against a remote cluster

## Contributing

### Contributing workflow

1. Search our [open issues](https://github.com/cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s/issues) in GitHub to see what features are planned.

1. Select an existing issue or open a new issue to propose changes or fixes.

1. Add the `implementing` label to the issue that you open or modify.

1. Run [existing tests](#testing) locally and ensure they pass.

1. Create a branch and add your changes. Include appropriate tests and ensure that they pass.

1. Submit a pull request, linking the issue in the description (e.g. Connected to #123).

1. Add the `implemented` label to the issue and request that a Cyberark engineer reviews and merges your code.

From here your pull request is reviewed. Once you have implemented all reviewer feedback, your code is merged into the project. Congratulations, you're a contributor!

### Testing

#### Unit testing

To run existing unit tests, run `./bin/test_unit`

When contributing to the CyberArk Secrets Provider for Kubernetes project, be sure to add the appropriate unit tests to either
already existing test files or create new ones.

To follow [Go testing conventions](https://golang.org/pkg/cmd/go/internal/test/) when creating a new test file, perform the following:

1. Create a new test file that matches the file naming pattern "*_test.go" in the proper `pkg` folder, close to the source code.

1. Add the following to the import statement at the beginning of the file

    ```go
    import (
        "testing"
    )
    ```

1. Create tests.

1. Run test suite, `./bin/test_unit`
  
#### Integration testing

Our integration tests can be run against either a GKE / Openshift remote cluster. To do so, run `./bin/start` and add the proper flags. 

To deploy Conjur Enterprise / Conjur Open Source, add the `--oss` / `--dap` flags to the above command. By default, the integration tests run Conjur Enterprise, so no flag is required.
To deploy on GKE, add `--gke`. For Openshift, use `--oldest` / `--current` / `--next`. By default, the integration tests run on a GKE cluster,
so no flag is required.

For example:

- Deploy Conjur Open Source on GKE, run  `./bin/start --oss --gke`
- Deploy Conjur Enterprise on Openshift, run  `./bin/start --dap --current`

It is also possible to run a single test instead of the full suite. This can be done by running `./bin/start` with the
flag `--test-prefix=<prefix>`. For example, running with the flag `--test-prefix=TEST_ID_18` will run only the test
`TEST_ID_18_helm_multiple_provider_multiple_secrets.sh`, or run with the flag `--test-prefix=*1[789]` to run tests 17,18,19.

When contributing new integration tests, perform the following:

1. Navigate to the `test/test_case` folder

1. Create a new test file with filename prefix `TEST_ID_<HIGHEST_NUMBER>_<TEST_NAME>`

If your tests follow the above instructions, our scripts should grab your test additions and run it as our test suite. 

That's it!

#### Tracing

To view tracing output from Secrets Provider, you can enable Jaeger tracing.

1. Create a local Jaeger instance.

    ```bash
    kubectl create namespace jaeger
    kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=jaeger
    helm repo add jaegertracing https://jaegertracing.github.io/helm-charts
    helm install jaeger jaegertracing/jaeger \
      --set provisionDataStore.cassandra=false \
      --set provisionDataStore.elasticsearch=true \
      --set storage.type=elasticsearch \
      --set elasticsearch.replicas=1 \
      --set elasticsearch.minimumMasterNodes=1
    ```

    Wait a few minutes for the Jaeger instance to be ready. Then run the following commands to expose the
    Jaeger UI on localhost:8080.

    ```bash
    pod_name=$(kubectl get pods --namespace jaeger -l "app.kubernetes.io/instance=jaeger,app.kubernetes.io/component=query" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
    kubectl port-forward --namespace jaeger $pod_name 8080:16686
    ```

2. Clone the [cyberark/conjur-authn-k8s-client](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-authn-k8s-client) repository which
contains the E2E tests. Edit the template file for the tests. For example, you can add the following to the `annotations`
section of `helm/conjur-app-deploy/charts/app-secrets-provider-p2f/templates/test_app_secrets_provider_p2f.yaml` for the
push to file E2E test:

    ```yaml
    conjur.org/jaeger-collector-url: http://jaeger-collector.jaeger.svc.cluster.local:14268/api/traces
    ```

    Now run the tests as usual with `cd bin/test-workflow && ./start -a secrets-provider-p2f`.


## Releases

Releases should be created by maintainers only. To create a tag and release,
follow the instructions in this section.

### Pre-requisites

1. Review the git log and ensure the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) contains all
   relevant recent changes with references to GitHub issues or PRs, if possible.
1. Review the changes since the last tag, and if the dependencies have changed
   revise the [NOTICES](NOTICES.txt) to correctly capture the included
   dependencies and their licenses / copyrights.
1. Ensure that all documentation that needs to be written has been 
   written by TW, approved by PO/Engineer, and pushed to the forward-facing documentation.
1. Scan the project for vulnerabilities

### Update the version, changelog, and notices

1. Create a new branch for the version bump.
1. Based on the changelog content, determine the new version number.
1. Update this version in the following files:
    1. [version.go](pkg/secrets/version.go)
    1. [Chart version](helm/secrets-provider/Chart.yaml)
    1. [Default deployed version](helm/secrets-provider/values.yaml)
    1. [Helm unit test for chart defaults](helm/secrets-provider/tests/secrets_provider_test.yaml)
    1. [Test case hardcoded version](deploy/test/test_cases/TEST_ID_22_helm_rbac_defaults_taken_successfully.sh)
1. Commit these changes - `Bump version to x.y.z` is an acceptable commit
   message - and open a PR for review.

### Push Helm package

1. Every build packages the Secrets Provider Helm chart for us. The package can be found under the 'Artifacts' tab of the Jenkins build and will resemble `secrets-provider-<version>.tgz`. 
Navigate to the 'Artifacts' tab of the _tagged version_ build and save this file. You will need it for the next step.
1. Clone the repo [helm-charts](https://github.com/cyberark/helm-charts) and do the following:
    1. Move the Helm package file created in the previous step to the *docs* folder in the `helm-charts` repo.
    1. Go to the `helm-charts` repo root folder and execute the `reindex.sh` script file located there.
    1. Create a PR with those changes.

### Release and Promote

1. Merging into main/master branches will automatically trigger a release. If successful, this release can be promoted at a later time.
1. Jenkins build parameters can be utilized to promote a successful release or manually trigger aditional releases as needed.
1. Reference the [internal automated release doc](https://github.com/conjurinc/docs/blob/master/reference/infrastructure/automated_releases.md#release-and-promotion-process) for releasing and promoting.

### Publish the Red Hat image

1. Visit the [Red Hat project page](https://connect.redhat.com/project/4381831/view) once the images have been pushed
and manually choose to publish the latest release.
